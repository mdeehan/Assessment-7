# Assessment-7
In our Assessment 7 flow chart file, you can see my thought process of how I approached the task at hand. I have a five option menu that can be utilized to add holidays, delete holidays, view holidays, save changes, and exit. When adding, deleting, or viewing holidays, the user will be ultimately utilizing a list of dictionaries that contain the name and date of every holiday in a given year. 
In our Assessment 7 Jupyter Notebook file (please let me know if this file is difficult to read), we have all my code. A sizeable portion of my code was used to make sure my various dictionaries and lists were working accordingly. For example, when scraping the https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/ website, I needed to perform multiple transformations to get the data into a "usable" form. In my code, I created a main menu function that uses 5 separate functions (addHoliday, viewHoliday, removeHoliday, exit, and save). This took up the main bulk of my code. I also used a weather api https://open-meteo.com/en/docs (documentation) to gather the weather data for this week (10/4 to 10/9); however, this section of my code was particularly buggy because I could not figure out how to match the dates provided by the api with the dates in my final_holidaylist because the dates in my list were formatted weirdly.
Following grading, I hope to sort out some of my bugs to ensure my code functions properly.
